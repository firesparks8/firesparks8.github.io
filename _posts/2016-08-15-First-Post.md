# Work-in-Progress
In an effort to get myself out of my comfort zone I have decided to start this page as a place to collect my thoughts, observations, great blog posts and other items related to Project Management. 

## A little about me:

I am a Certified Paralegal and Project Manager in the Global HR Compliance department. My role in this department is very fluid related to the needs of the department. Some days I am putting on my executive assistant hat for the GVP, other days Project managing one of the 4-5 projects under my purview and other days I am preparing, organizing and maintaining data related to major litigation cases. I am a team player - so being flexible is something that comes naturally to me. In my prior role, I went from being an entry-level paralegal to Operations Manager in 2 years. My success in this regard is largely due to my team-player mentality: I started putting together reference guides to streamline the rules and requirements of the legal foreclosure world and crystalize the processes around it for our state. At that time, a lot of people I worked with were concerned about documenting their procedures because they felt that not sharing their knowledged preserved their SME role within the company. From my perspective, there is more security when things are being done right in a department and not just at an individual level. A department is only as good as it's weakest link. That ended up with me being promoted to a team leader, then manager and then eventually a Operations Manger reporting to the COO of the company and having up to 44 direct reports. 

Thanks for stopping by!
