# Work-in-Progress
*Date: 08.15.2016*

In an effort to get myself out of my comfort zone I have decided to start this page as a place to collect my thoughts, observations, great blog posts and other items related to HR & Project Management. 

## A little about me:

I am a Certified Paralegal, an HR Professional, and a Project Manager in a Global HR Compliance department. 

My role in this department is very fluid related to the needs of the department. Some days I am putting on my executive assistant hat for the GVP, other days I am Project managing one of the 4-5 projects under my purview; and while still other days I am preparing, organizing and maintaining data related to major litigation cases. 

I am a team player - so being flexible is something that comes naturally to me. In my prior role, I went from being an entry-level paralegal to Operations Manager in less than 18 months. My success in this regard is largely due to my team-player mentality: I started putting together reference guides to streamline the rules and requirements of the legal foreclosure world and crystalize the processes around it for our state. At that time, a lot of people I worked with were concerned about documenting their procedures because they felt that by not sharing their knowledge, they preserved their SME role within the company. 

In my view, there is more security for an organization when things are being done right in across the entire department, and not just at an individual level. A department is only as good as it's weakest link. That ended up with me being promoted to a team leader, then manager and then eventually a Operations Manger reporting to the COO of the company and having (at one time) up to 44 direct reports. 

Outside of work - I spend a lot of time championing environmental, animal rights or human rights related causes.  My husband and I foster shelter dogs as often as we can. I work on my positive reinforcement training with our rescue dog daily. I love to go hiking or out on the boat and be outside with nature. While out there, I typically take a lot of photos. It's another long-time hobby of mine. 

My husband and I love to travel to new places - our last big exploratory trip was the Pacific Northwest - which has become one of our favorite regions. We also visit Karpathos, Greece (where my mother was born and I grew up partly) every other summer.

When it comes to downtime: I love to watch Comedians in Cars getting Coffee or 30Rock, Parks and Rec, New Girl, The Mindy Project, STNG, Frasiter, and Friends on Netflix. My favorite show still on-air is Game of Thrones (Tyrion Targaryen has a nice ring to it, no?). 

I watch way more fan theory videos on YouTube than I should admit to.

So that is a little bit about me, thanks for stopping by!
