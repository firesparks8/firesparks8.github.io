# Reflections on a Captains log
In honor of the 50th anniversary of the Star Trek franchise; I have decided to binge watch episodes from my favorite progeny of the series: Star Trek: Next Generation.
I vividly recall my first introduction to ST:NG. When I was in middle school; it used to come on after Batman the animated series or Gargoyles. 

No one in my family was a sci-fi fan, but I was drawn to it. 
It started in the books I read (I devoured Madeliene L'Engle's lovely books) and then grew into a love and appreciation of sci-fi. 
But I only loved a certain type of sci-fi; one that inspired hope. 
A hope for advancement as a civilization or of some greater more actualized and egalitarian way to be.
So when I happened to come across ST:NG, I fell in love. 

## Engage
In rewatching these episodes, I am revisiting the interactions between Captain Picard and his direct reports from an HR professional perspective. 
In all his interactions with his officers, he is respectful, complimentary, consistent, loyal to his crew (to the point of fighting for the rights his crew, human and android alike) and always honest with his intent and perspectives.
Most importantly, though, is how he reacts to the crew who disagree with him or conduct acts of disobedience which turn out to have been for the crew or Starfleet's benefit. 
He always tempers his judgment; even in the moment (the majority of the time). He pauses instead of filling the vacuum of noise during an argument. Sometimes he dismisses a crew member when things get heated, but even that is what all managers should do.
In the episode "Unnatural Selection" he finds himself bumping heads with his new/temporary medical officer. 
At one point, they are arguing over what to do with people from a quarantined planet. The Captain repeatedly states what the rules are under quarantine.
Then the doctor offers a proposal, a compromise - midargument. 
Captain Picard - rather than arguing - pauses, reflects and responds that he has approved her approach because he recognized her compromise.
It was just, perfect conflict resolution. But let me be clear, in the duration of the show Picard does make mistakes. Mistakes in judgment or with his crew.
He is not a perfect person, but it is how he recognizes and addresses his own imperfections that to me is what needs to be paid attention to. He does the right thing at the end of the day.
I have come to the conclusion, more managers should be required to watch these episodes and take notes on how Captain Picard handles the people management aspect of his job.
Which is actually a huge part of his day to day responsibilities. Just as it is with most managers. 
As I was recognizing the perfection of Captain Picard's management techniques and abilities, I realized: in a lot of ways his manner as a manager has likely been in my head for the past 20+ years.
Somewhere, subliminally, it is this type of manager-archetype I have judged all my previous managers off of. 
You could say it's unfair, but I am sure we all do this. Whether you are conscious of it or not. 
Whether it's Obi-wan or Chief Webber or Michael Scott or Leslie Knope or Jack Donaghey or Daniel Hillard's cool boss in Mrs. Doubtfire. We have these fictional character managerial/boss/mentor archetypes in our heads.

###Grand
I understand that Captain Picard is a fictional character and is not an actual leader. Unfortunately, we don't or can't have stream situations handled by actual great leaders or managers.

Also, what are all those manager videos than just narratives about people management techniques? 
By having a narrative that deals in every episode with problem-solving on a daily basis and then shows how leaders handle their people management skills in response to these problems, actually, could be thought of as a source of wisdom. 
It shows aspects of management as well as collaborative skill management and change management. 
Sure it is in a fictional environment, but - again, aren't all those managerial webinars or scenarios we often are made to sit through also fictional? 

####Captain's Log
So I guess my point is, any manager of people, should rewatch these shows - whether it be STNG or the Office or Parks and Rec or 30Rock - but watch them with an eye for: what are these managers doing right? what are these leaders doing right? 

When you do this, when you actually pay attention, there is so much to glean about: leadership, work culture, the importance of autonomy and purpose to a direct report, embracing and pushing for the growth of direct reports, the importance of loyalty from a manager towards his reports (even in the face of diversity) and - most importantly - the importance of being able to admit to imperfections/mistakes as a manager and when a direct report is right.

In closing, I am currently watching the "Measure of a Man" episode of ST:NG. In it, Captain Picard fights for the rights of Lieutenant Data to be given personhood/sentient being rights in the fact of another officer wanting to disassemble him for science. This episode is pretty progressive, considering we are talking about how we should consider our creations - in this case, specifically androids. 
Captain Picard goes to the matt for Data. He eventually breaks down the argument against granting Data these rights and recognition by breaking down what the definition of "sentience" is. It's a beautiful defense of Data. 
But more importantly, it displays, yet again - the importance of loyalty from a manager to a direct report. Sure, this defense was significant for Data. 
Imagine, if you will, the effect of this story of Captain Picard's defense of Data once it spreads to his crew? What would that do? 
I am pretty sure that this narrative would make his crew's feelings of loyalty and pride towards him multiply exponentially. It would add to the culture of the Enterprise; reinforcing why the crew stays on that ship and serves under him. It reminds each crew member of their autonomy in their jobs aboard the ship, but also in their choice of staying on the ship.It reinforces to them that they made the right decision to be assigned to the Enterprise.

So next time you find yourself in a difficult or complex situation in your work or with your direct reports. Take a beat. Reflect. 

And ask yourself, what would Jean Luc do?
