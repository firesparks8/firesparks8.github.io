# I drink and I know things

*Date: 07.14.2017*

In honor of the forthcoming season 7 premiere of Game of Thrones happening this Sunday, I have decided to rewatch the series and determine what lessons I could glean in relation to leadership.

Whether you are a Project Manager or an HR representative, an Administrator or an Executive – one thing you need to be able to do is lead. Even if it is just yourself. Being able to lead yourself and others through adversity, is a significant skill to hone and one that will help you down your career path. 

That being said, why not reflect upon the strategies that have led the main protagonists in the show to where they are now? Sure, the setting isn’t the modern day professional workspace. But the basics haven’t changed much. People are still people. Motivated mostly by fear and aversion to those fears. We may not have dragon’s or White Walkers – but *we do have* tension filled commutes, office politics, strategic positioning, suspicion, backstabbing, and closed-door dealing. Has *that* much really changed?

Oh and if you are NOT fully caught up through Season 6 - #ThispostisDarkandfullofSpoilers

## I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. - Cersei

When it comes to Cersei and her leadership style it is basically one built from fear. Everyone she employs, in some way, fears her. I’m sure Qyburn knows that if he doesn’t perform admirably he will be disposed of. Hence why he even apologized to murdering Maester Pycelle in his last words to him. I’m sure even Zombie Mountain fears her in his own, undead way. The more power she has gained over the season, the more she has exemplified this leadership style. I think what those who are employed by her worry most about is the fear of failing her and dealing with the wrath of her perceived slight.  

What we have seen in this series is that:  due to the self-centered choices Cersei has made in her pursuit of power, she has increasingly become more and more alone. By letting her son, King Joeffrey, mirror this leadership style to the extreme – it ultimately led to his death. By choosing the Mountain to be her champion against Oberon Martell, she created the hostile situation with those in Dorne, which led to her daughter Marcella’s untimely death. By not immediately comforting her son, King Tommen, after she blew up the Sept of Baelor – in his distraught state, by himself and without any explanation of what just happened  - he committed suicide.  Rather than being with him, she chose to torture Septa Unella. These choices have led to her only real confidant being her paramour (and brother) Jamie. We will see what happens with that relationship this season, but I see it deteriorating as well.  

There are still a lot of modern day managers and ‘professionals’ who think the best way to procure what you want from others. The truth is, if you look closely at those that practice this leadership style you will see that their turnover is through the roof. These types of manager/leaders show no loyalty to others and only to themselves and their interests. Their staff will jump at the first opportunity to align themselves with other managers/leaders. This leadership style is one swiftly walking down the path of extinction as companies more closely pay attention to turnover rates and have realized that good talent doesn’t quit companies, they quit bad managers. 

Ultimately, this leadership style is one that has been utilized for thousands of years of human existence. There was a time, relatively recently, when it was justified by comparing it to the way a wolf pack is organized. With the Alpha Male and Female dealing swift justice to any who challenge their position. The reality is, that not even wolf pack’s work this way. Yes, they may have leaders, but they lead through sharing, empathy, teamwork, and tenderness to their pack. Not fear. They are more egalitarian than we initially thought. Which is something more modern leaders should encompass.

## Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. - Jon

<img src="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Wigler/20160602_ep609_Publicity_still_041.00141346[1].jpg-EMBED.jpg">
Jon Snow. Or Jaeharys Targaryen. The Prince who was promised. Fire and ice. Bastard. 

Jon is one of the most lovable characters on the show because he is authentic, humble, appreciative, forthright, and mostly righteous. He sacrifices himself for the sake of others time and again. Whether it is forsaking the only woman he ever loved (Ygritte) in order to go back to the Wall and report on the wildlings. Or refusing to return to Winterfell after the death and dispersion of his family members, because he swore an oath. Or charging the whole Bolton army after seeing Ramsay kill his brother, regardless of the consequences.

One thing you note with Jon is he makes friends and strong allies with ease. He makes no real effort to do this. He just is his authentic self and in that way others are attracted to him. Something about his quiet determination and ethical compass speaks to those around him. Considering he has lived a life that was a mixture of luxury and scorn; it speaks multitudes about his internal motivations that he has turned out to be so selfless. He had a step mother who despised him. A ‘father’ who remained distant and secretive about his real mother. Luckily, he had siblings that mostly treated him equally. Obviously, a few of them never let him forget his ‘place’. 

What can a modern day professional learn from Jon Snow? That it doesn’t take brown-nosing and overt words of flattery to endear yourself to others. Having a strong moral compass, a teamwork mentality, and ultimately the ability to make sacrifices for the greater good - appeals to everyone. It also encourages honesty and loyalty from those around you. You never see Jon lose his cool during a discussion about strategy with others. Even if he disagrees. He speaks his mind and let’s others speak theirs. Even when he was Lord Commander – his approach was one of genuine care for his brothers and for the realm in general. Of course those who don’t have this inert ability to attract loyalty, became his biggest haters. 

And ultimately killed him. 

The only thing Jon lacked (pre-death) was the awareness that not everyone should be given the benefit of the doubt. That, given the opportunity, people that dislike him won’t follow the rules of respect and ethics and may try to hurt or kill him. 

Luckily, the modern professional does not need to worry about getting shanked. But, I would say that they do need to be aware of who they can consider an ally and who they need to keep at arms-length. Something as simple as letting off some steam in the office can have serious consequences. You need to know who you can talk to in confidence, and – more importantly - who you can’t. Also, there is something important to glean about being your authentic-self around others. Doing so will attract people who genuinely like you and can be those you can lean on in the office.

## My reign has just begun. - Daenerys

What can I say about Daenerys, that hasn’t already been said? She is compassionate, she has strong ethics, she has a strong will, and she has dragons. What’s not to love? She does have to be careful about disconnecting too much from others as she continues to move higher and higher in her leadership role. Another to remember is that what really put her father over to the dark side was when he was captured and tortured by a nearby house that was feuding with him. He didn’t just go mad on his own. It was a severe form of PTSD that led him down the path of totally disconnecting with reality. 

That being said, the one thing that Danny seems to exceed in (compared to all the other current leaders) is a compassion for the people. In a prior season, she talked about all the houses that are constantly jockeying for power and control. She compared them to spokes on a wheel and she stated she would break the wheel. She seems to have an acute perspective where she realizes that these people don’t chose these battles. They are indentured to fight in them. It’s a perspective that very few leaders in Westeros seem to have and it is significant. Also, how she made it her mission to free the slaves in cities where slavery has been going on for thousands of years was strategic on two levels: 1) it added to her fighting force in taking over the cities from the inside; 2) it made her so beloved that all the slaves she freed called her “mother”. 

What the modern professional can learn from Daenerys, is the importance of empathizing with your co-workers and team mates. Realizing and reminding yourself that everyone has something they are dealing with outside of work is essential to building strong relationships with your co-workers. When a teammate seems to be “slacking” on a work item or a direct report seems “disconnected” – reach out to them. Ask if everything is ok or if there is anything you can help them with. Sometimes, just the offer, can make a world of a difference. Being the empathetic person in the office is always an important way to build allies and relationships that can often help you in your efforts to grow professionally. 

The other attribute that Danny has that more people need in the workplace: is confidence and sense of self. Danny knows what she wants, she knows what she can accomplish, she has faith in herself. She is a reminder of how important an internal drive is. More than once she has found herself in situations of destitution. Each time, she has worked her way to the top. At the start of the series, she started as an insecure and timid young girl. But she has utilized all her experiences to give her strength. This is a very important lesson for any professional and an attribute we should all be cultivating within ourselves.
