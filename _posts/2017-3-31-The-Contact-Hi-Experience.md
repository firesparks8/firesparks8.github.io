# Small moves, Ellie. Small moves
As I have mentioned in a prior post, I am a fan of optimistic Science Fiction. When the movie Contact came out, I was just starting the 8th grade. I remember loving the whole premise of the movie so much that I read the book and then bought and listened to the audiobook (ON CASSETTE TAPE!) when I would go on long road trips with my family. The images in the movie and so many aspects of the book have become ingrained in how I view the universe and my deep respect for scientists. Prior to reading Carl Sagan, I devoured Madeleine L'Engle's series of books. I read the "Time Quintet", "The Austin Family", "O'Keefe Family", and "Genesis Trilogy". I would order them from the library (yes, you could do that!)(PS I am 32, this wasn't *that* long ago). In many ways I feel her blend of the scientific and the spiritual set me up to immediately fall in love with "Contact" and Carl Sagan's other works. His ability to bluntly discuss,acknowledge and ponder the similarities and differences of both the pursuits of the scientific and the spiritual in his characters - just mesmerized me. I also think, he very accurately tapped in - in this book and many of his other works - of a deeper need so many of us find within us: the feeling that what we do is important and that we contribute something important to the world. Even if it is on some small level. Granted, this need isn't often focused on until an individual's basic needs are met (see: <b href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow</a>)

## I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space.


## You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares.
