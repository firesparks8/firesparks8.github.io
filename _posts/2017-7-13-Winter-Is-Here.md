# I drink and I know things

*Date: 07.14.2017*

In honor of the forthcoming season 7 premiere of Game of Thrones happening this Sunday, I have decided to rewatch the series and determine what lessons I could glean in relation to leadership.

Whether you are a Project Manager or an HR representative, an Administrator or an Executive – one thing you need to be able to do is lead. Even if it is just yourself. Being able to lead yourself and others through adversity, is a significant skill to hone and one that will help you down your career path. 

That being said, why not reflect upon the strategies that have led the main protagonists in the show to where they are now? Sure, the setting isn’t the modern day professional workspace. But the basics haven’t changed much. People are still people. Motivated mostly by fear and aversion to those fears. We may not have dragon’s or White Walkers – but *we do have* tension filled commutes, office politics, strategic positioning, suspicion, backstabbing, and closed-door dealing. Has *that* much really changed?

## I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. - Cersei

When it comes to Cersei and her leadership style it is basically one built from fear. Everyone she employs, in some way, fears her. I’m sure Qyburn knows that if he doesn’t perform admirably he will be disposed of. Hence why he even apologized to murdering Maester Pycelle in his last words to him. I’m sure even Zombie Mountain fears her in his own, undead way. The more power she has gained over the season, the more she has exemplified this leadership style. I think what those who are employed by her worry most about is the fear of failing her and dealing with the wrath of her perceived slight.  

What we have seen in this series is that:  due to the self-centered choices Cersei has made in her pursuit of power, she has increasingly become more and more alone. By letting her son, King Joeffrey, mirror this leadership style to the extreme – it ultimately led to his death. By choosing the Mountain to be her champion against Oberon Martell, she created the hostile situation with those in Dorne, which led to her daughter Marcella’s untimely death. By not immediately comforting her son, King Tommen, after she blew up the Sept of Baelor – in his distraught state, by himself and without any explanation of what just happened  - he committed suicide.  Rather than being with him, she chose to torture Septa Unella. These choices have led to her only real confidant being her paramour (and brother) Jamie. We will see what happens with that relationship this season, but I see it deteriorating as well.  

There are still a lot of modern day managers and ‘professionals’ who think the best way to procure what you want from others. The truth is, if you look closely at those that practice this leadership style you will see that their turnover is through the roof. These types of manager/leaders show no loyalty to others and only to themselves and their interests. Their staff will jump at the first opportunity to align themselves with other managers/leaders. This leadership style is one swiftly walking down the path of extinction as companies more closely pay attention to turnover rates and have realized that good talent doesn’t quit companies, they quit bad managers. 

Ultimately, this leadership style is one that has been utilized for thousands of years of human existence. There was a time, relatively recently, when it was justified by comparing it to the way a wolf pack is organized. With the Alpha Male and Female dealing swift justice to any who challenge their position. The reality is, that not even wolf pack’s work this way. Yes, they may have leaders, but they lead through sharing, empathy, teamwork, and tenderness to their pack. Not fear. They are more egalitarian than we initially thought. Which is something more modern leaders should encompass.
