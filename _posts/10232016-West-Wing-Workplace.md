# Reflections on the best televised Two Term Presidency (Under Construction)
In honor of being less than 1 week away from the closure of the most contentious election in recent memory, I have decided to rewatch "The West Wing". Being a person who fervently studied political science in college and contemplated a career in that area - I actually do not like to watch many political dramas. Similar to my taste in sci-fi, I only like political drama's that are hopeful. I am very aware of the corrupt underbelly that exists in politics, I don't need it shoved in my face (aka House of Cards or Scandal). I prefer shows that can depict a realistic portrayal of government and specifically,show how we can make the best of it. How we can face the snarling, belligerent beast that exists in DC - and make it submit to progressive ideals that benefit and protect the citizens of this country.

I decided to rewatch the series because I am sick, tired and disparaged of the 24/7 news cycle of this so-called presidential election. Regardless of your feelings on these candidates, as a country - we deserve and should expect better. From our candidates, from our primaries, from our debates, from our media all of it. On both sides of the isle.

If you have never watched the show, watch season 7. If you can't watch the whole thing, watch episode 7 of season 7. That debate is what we should expect of all Presidential debates as far as substance and passion. Something we definitely did not have during this years Presidential debates. 

While binging the series, I couldn't help but put my HR/company culture hat on and analyze the decisions made on the show as they pertain to  people management in general, the ever elusive work-life balance, and approaches to stress in the workplace while staying respectful.

##Ways and Means
The one thing that you initially come away with when you watch this show is the immense sense of importance that every person sitting in that White House feel everyday. Only 10% (give or take) of the world's population feel that their work brings them purpose. The people in this show are that 10%; which is what makes them so compelling. When you look at the staff of a White House in the way it is shown on this show, you realize that the team that ends up in the White House advising the President are basically the President's war buddies. They are the people - who with their talents combined - made a dream a reality. They were in the trenches for a year plus, working for a person they truly and unabashadly believe in (or at least, hopefully that's why they did it). They took major risks to their lives, their careers, their health....all for one unified mission: get their candidate elected. It's all strategy, it's all forethought, it's all discussion and devil's advocacy. And once they do it - once they get their candidate elected - that wiring they have honed for the past year will prove essential to get them thru their everyday workload in the White House. 

I definitely understand that a lot of those "team-building seminars" that are held where people climb up telephone polls or do trust-falls come from trying to artificially/forcefully create this type of commradery. But I fear, nothing will ever measure up unless there are some real consequences on the line that brings people together. I would say the original group involved in a start-up probably also experiences a similar effect. I think there is something in that - that we as HR folks could garner. Maybe it would be best to try to hire people in groups of two. If not in the same sections, at least in the same departments. To help new hires have someone right from the beginning to go thru that experience with. Maybe also we try to create more opportunities to get departments to work together as a unit on projects for their sector. Perhaps have them put together presentations about items they are working on every quarter. I just find that without this kind of bonding situation on a team, you end up with issues such as retention, departmental loyalty, etc. Putting a little more effort up front could save a lot of headaches down the road.
