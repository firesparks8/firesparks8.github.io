# Small moves, Ellie. Small moves
As I have mentioned in a prior post, I am a fan of optimistic Science Fiction. When the movie Contact came out, I was just starting the 8th grade. I remember being so inspired by the premise of the movie that I read the book *and* listened to the audiobook (ON CASSETTE TAPE!) when I would go on long road trips with my family. The images in the movie and so many aspects of the book have become ingrained in how I view the universe and my deep respect for scientists. 

Carl Sagan's ability to bluntly discuss, acknowledge, and ponder the similarities and differences of both the pursuits of the scientific and the spiritual in his characters - just mesmerized me. I also think, he very accurately tapped into a deeper need so many of us find within us: the hope that what we do is important and that we have the opportunity to contribute something important to the world *or* to others. Even if it is on some small level. Granted, this need isn't often focused on until an individual's basic needs are met (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Maslow</a>). 

I recently started thinking about how this movie/book formed some early expectations and aspirations within me - when it came to the traditional thought of 'what will I be when I grow up'. My goal with this post is unpack some of what *Contact* represents and what lessons can be learned by an HR professional *and* a Project Manager.

## I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space.

The beginning of the movie begins with a young Ellie Arroway looking at the stars. 

How many of us - when we were young - had hoped to be something utterly different from what we've become? It is the very rare, gifted, and (in many regards) tenacious individuals who end up doing *exactly* what they said they were going to do when they were 8 or 9 years old. There are a myriad of reasons for that. Some of us had hoped to be a profession that maybe we lacked certain attributes for; e.g. I wanted to be a Veterinarian until I hit the 9th grade. At that time, I researched what it would take to become a Veterinarian and I convinced myself that I lacked the required level of mathematical aptitude - I then switched  professional pursuits. 

There are also life events (and survival of those events) that get in the way of purusing some of these dreams. Ultimately, there are a lot of scenarios that lead to what people end up doing for a living. As an HR professional or Project Manager - that is something you need to understand and empathize with when working with a group of people. It is helpful so that when people seemingly let you down; you can reflect that perhaps the above is the root of that failure. It could be an unconscious manifestation of regret or guilt or frustration that they didn't go down some other path. 

What that means to *you*, as a HR Professional or Project Manager, is that those individuals may need a little more coaching and an identification (provided by you) of an internal motivation that maybe they never previously recognized in their current profession. 

It may take a bit of dialogue to find the motivation; but the investment up front in this regard will save you a lot of strain - and possibly save them a job - in the long run. Helping people find the thing that motivates them may seem common sense to most - but a lot of people do not take the time to do this for themselves. They are often too busy, too distracted - both at home and in the workplace - to do this sort of introspeection on their own. By you making an attempt to guide them, it will also allow you to create a personal connection with them which will be helpful in your working relationship in the future. They will know that you value them as a person, not just as an employee. This is *incredibly* important. This conversation doesn't have to take more than 30 minutes. As long as you approach them from a place of interest (and not that you are talking to them because their work quality is concerning) - you can normally achieve the goal of this dialogue with some pointed questions. *A little extra up front investment, will turn a profit*.

## I've had my eye on you a long time, Doctor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePa6eUxhkYo">You are one of my most valuable long term investments</a>.

I am linking you to a key scene that relates to Ellie Arroway being approached in the middle of the night by an intelligent, ecentric billionaire who reveals that he has been quietly watching her work and investing in her from afar. 

This interaction has remained with me my entire professional career. How *amazing* would it be to get this kind of reception from a prospective employer? To have a recruiter or hiring manager reach out to you referencing your professional or educational background and accomplishments and why they think *you* are a great person or a good fit for *their* organization. 

Now, while back in the 90s it was impressive the variety of footage he had about Dr. Arroway; nowadays it doesn't take extensive Google-sleuthing to find a substantial amount of information about an individual. Between what they post themselves and what others post about them, you could hypothetically build a relatively extensive candidate profile - outside of what they provide you in a resume and cover letter. 

A lot of applicants give you a lot of information *in* their resumes that can go overlooked during the screening process. I can't tell you how many times I've been on calls with recruiters who did little to know prep work before a screening call. 

Taking those extra steps before a call shows a candidate you care and that you pay attention to detail. 

Honestly, it will also save you time down the line if you pay an extra bit of attention to a resume *before* that screener call. You may be able to gleen whether the individual would actually be a great fit for the organization or what talents they bring to the table. 

Finally, as a recruiter or even a hiring manager - you represent your company to all potential candidates. Even if a candidate doesn't get the job; impressing them with some extra research and pointed questions that relate to their backgrounds or accomplishments - really goes a long way in elevating a company profile among the applicant community.

The above can also apply to a Project Manager who does some extra work when they are assigned new reports to a project team. Doing some investigation both internally and externally and familiarizing yourself with what they have done in the past can help you better understand their capaibilities and where different team members compliment eachother. It can also shed light to what tasks may best compliment or bring the best out of a person's attribute. This is definitely useful when being assigned a new project team or in a consulting project management role. Your team member's will appreciate the extra care you've spent forming their team profiles and trying to match them with tasks that will resonate with them.

## You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares.

Ultimately, I think the primary lesson that one comes away with from an HR professional or Project Management perspective is: when it comes to your reports, project team members, or potential candidates - *be respectful, be empathetic and be compassionate*. 

Not every employee is going to necessarily *deserve* the extra time and effort I recommend above; but it is always worth the investment. 

In our interactions with others it is paramount to respect them as individuals with dreams and aspirations who are seeking a little bit more out of their professional experience; not just being treated as another cog in the wheel.
