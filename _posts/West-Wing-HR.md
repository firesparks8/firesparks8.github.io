# Reflections on the best televised Two Term Presidency
In honor of being less than 2 weeks away from the closure of the worst election in recent memory, I have decided to rewatch "The West Wing". Being a person who fervently studied political science in college and contemplated a career in that area - I actually do not like to watch many political dramas. Similar to my taste in sci-fi, I only like political drama's that are hopeful. I am very aware of the corrupt underbelly that exists in politics, I don't need it shoved in my face (aka House of Cards or Scandal). I prefer shows that can depict a realistic portrayal of government and specifically,show how we can make the best of it. How we can face the snarling, belligerent beast that exists in DC - and make it submit to progressive ideals that benefit and protect the citizens of this country.

I decided to rewatch the series because I am sick, tired and disparaged of the 24/7 news cycle of this so-called presidential election. Regardless of your feelings on these candidates, as a country - we deserve and should expect better. From our candidates, from our primaries, from our debates, all of it. On both sides of the isle.

If you have never watched the show, watch season 7. If you can't watch the whole thing, watch episode 7 of season 7. That debate is what we should expect of all Presidential debates as far as substance and passion. Something we definitely did not have during this years Presidential debates. 

While binging the series, I couldn't help but put my HR hat on and analyze the decisions made on the show as they pertain to  people management in general, the ever elusive work-life balance, and approaches to stress in the workplace while staying respectful.
